## TO RUN
- update the URL to the event you want to scrape in the following files:
  - EventResults.py
  - MatchUp.py
  - Characters.py

### TODO
[] - put helper files into a seperate folders
[] - make URL var be shared across all files so changes will only have to be made in one file
[] - scrape an entire season instead of each event
